# working on git 

Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repositories

    You already have two separate repositories for frontend and backend. Ensure both are on GitHub.
    Add your friend as a collaborator to the respective repo(s):
        Go to the repo on GitHub.
        Click Settings > Manage access.
        Click Invite a collaborator and enter your friend’s GitHub username/email.

Step 2: Enforce Pull Request Reviews

To ensure that no code is merged without your approval:

    Go to the repository settings → Branches.
    Under Branch protection rules, click Add rule.
    Set Branch name pattern to main or develop (or whichever branch you want to protect).
    Enable:
        ✅ Require a pull request before merging
        ✅ Require approvals (set it to at least 1 review, which will be you)
        ✅ Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed (optional)
        ✅ Include administrators (if you also want to be forced to review your own PRs)
    Save the settings.

Now, your friend cannot push directly to main—they must create a pull request (PR), which you will review and approve before merging.
Step 3: Notification on Changes

Whenever your friend pushes code and opens a Pull Request (PR):

    You will receive an email notification (if enabled).
    You can also get GitHub mobile app notifications.
    If you use Slack, Discord, or Telegram, you can set up a GitHub webhook to notify you.

Step 4: Workflow for Working Together

    Your friend clones the frontend repo and creates a new feature branch:

git checkout -b feature-new-ui

They make changes, commit, and push the branch:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated homepage UI"
    git push origin feature-new-ui

    On GitHub, they open a Pull Request (PR).
    You get notified and review the changes.
    If everything is good, you approve and merge the PR.
    Repeat for future updates.

Bonus: Automate with GitHub Actions

    You can set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically test frontend or backend changes before merging.
    Use GitHub Actions to notify you on Discord/Slack whenever a PR is created.
