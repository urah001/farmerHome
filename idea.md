# working on git 

Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repositories

    You already have two separate repositories for frontend and backend. Ensure both are on GitHub.
    Add your friend as a collaborator to the respective repo(s):
        Go to the repo on GitHub.
        Click Settings > Manage access.
        Click Invite a collaborator and enter your friend‚Äôs GitHub username/email.

Step 2: Enforce Pull Request Reviews

To ensure that no code is merged without your approval:

    Go to the repository settings ‚Üí Branches.
    Under Branch protection rules, click Add rule.
    Set Branch name pattern to main or develop (or whichever branch you want to protect).
    Enable:
        ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
        ‚úÖ Require approvals (set it to at least 1 review, which will be you)
        ‚úÖ Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed (optional)
        ‚úÖ Include administrators (if you also want to be forced to review your own PRs)
    Save the settings.

Now, your friend cannot push directly to main‚Äîthey must create a pull request (PR), which you will review and approve before merging.
Step 3: Notification on Changes

Whenever your friend pushes code and opens a Pull Request (PR):

    You will receive an email notification (if enabled).
    You can also get GitHub mobile app notifications.
    If you use Slack, Discord, or Telegram, you can set up a GitHub webhook to notify you.

Step 4: Workflow for Working Together

    Your friend clones the frontend repo and creates a new feature branch:

git checkout -b feature-new-ui

They make changes, commit, and push the branch:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated homepage UI"
    git push origin feature-new-ui

    On GitHub, they open a Pull Request (PR).
    You get notified and review the changes.
    If everything is good, you approve and merge the PR.
    Repeat for future updates.

Bonus: Automate with GitHub Actions

    You can set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically test frontend or backend changes before merging.
    Use GitHub Actions to notify you on Discord/Slack whenever a PR is created.
